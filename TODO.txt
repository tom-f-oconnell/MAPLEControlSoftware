- consistent interface for setting placement + bounds checking modules in
  workspace
  - let each module define required positions of each effector within module
    coord sys, then have this interface transform for placement
  - define module extents (bounding box? polygon?)


- source / sink classes
    - morgue subclassing sink
    - maybe both subclassing some "Module" class for bounds checking?

- whether or not we refactor s.t. workspace modules are classes, should probably
  make it so IO related stuff isn't done automatically on import, but explicitly
  by some init() type function
    - which could be a method of the parent class


- fn to generate config for things you'd otherwise need to measure upon hardware
  changes?
    - is it just max Z for each axis?


- make fov config params not required if camera is disabled (if they even are
  now)

- make expectation / module/experiment design workflow more clear in
  instructions, especially to the extent that it can not be programmatically
  enforced

- methods in robot class that place workspace (transform to more std. coords? +
  bounds check) and modules within

- some representation of order of operations? (or use cases too general for this
  to be useful, because of need for different conditions or whatever?)

- function to generate one possible mounting plate from workspace
    - also take values from robot config (workspace size?)

- !!! change all onOff to positional arg, to unbreak that valve switching !!!

- provide facilities to compile to gcode for fully open loop protocols
  - (would also help to eliminate communication delays, so if we could
    artificially constrain the planning buffer, it could measure the
    relative contributions of planning / communications related delays)
